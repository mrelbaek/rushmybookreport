## üèõ High-Level Architecture

- **Landing Page:** Server-side rendered page with a prominent order form.
- **Order Form:** Client-side component that collects user input and triggers API request.
- **API Layer:**
  - `/api/generate` handles incoming orders.
  - Calls OpenAI GPT-4 to generate customized book reports.
- **OpenAI Integration:**
  - GPT-4 generates book reports using carefully tuned prompts.
  - Optionally matches a provided writing sample for realism.
- **Dynamic Delivery:**
  - Generated reports are returned immediately to frontend.
  - (Planned) Emailing reports to customers for easier delivery.
- **Payments (Planned):**
  - Stripe checkout links for Standard and Rush orders.
  - Promo codes available through Stripe Coupons.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Development Approach

- **MVP-first mentality:** Focused on shipping a working version quickly with core functionality.
- **Separation of concerns:**  
  - API call logic is separated from UI components.
  - OpenAI logic isolated inside `lib/openai.ts` for easy maintenance.
- **SSR/CSR handling:**  
  - Avoid hydration mismatches by keeping dynamic fetching entirely inside client-side `Form.tsx`.
- **Extendability:**  
  - Project is built to easily support new features like:
    - Additional homework types (essays, summaries)
    - User accounts and report history
    - Admin panel for rush order management

## üìö Key Learnings

- **Next.js App Router nuances:** 
  - Careful handling of server vs client components is critical to avoid hydration mismatches.
- **OpenAI SDK v4 update:** 
  - New import and usage pattern (no `Configuration`/`OpenAIApi` ‚Äî unified `OpenAI` object).
- **Handling dynamic AI data on SSR:** 
  - Always load dynamic data client-side unless snapshotting is possible.
- **Speed matters:** 
  - In a panic-driven market (students needing reports), UX simplicity is king over visual complexity.
- **Clean API structure:** 
  - Keeping API routes clean and stateless is easier for scaling and debugging.

## üåü Future Improvements (Planned)

- Email the generated book report automatically to the customer after generation.
- Save all orders (and fulfillment status) into Supabase for tracking.
- Stripe promo codes and tiered pricing (bulk reports, loyalty discounts).
- Admin dashboard for rush orders prioritization.
- Customizable writing error rate (add X mistakes for realism).
- Multilingual support (book reports in Spanish, French, etc).
- Fully mobile-optimized flow.
